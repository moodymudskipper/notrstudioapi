# notrstudioapi

Very rough sketch, many things including the name are likely to change
or break.

On github for the issue tracker mainly.

{notrstudioapi} extends {rstudioapi} to be able to conveniently close or
move tabs, show diffs between unsaved and saved, restore tabs from cache
etc.

It’s been developped because it’s needed for {tricks} but has general
features that fit better in a separate package.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/notrstudioapi")
```
