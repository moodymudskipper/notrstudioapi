# notrstudioapi

Very rough sketch, many things including the name are likely to change or break.

On github for the issue tracker mainly.

{notrstudioapi} extends {rstudioapi} to be able to conveniently close or move tabs,
show diffs between unsaved and saved, restore tabs from cache etc.

It's been developped because it's needed for {tricks} but has general features that fit better in a separate package. 

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/notrstudioapi")
```
